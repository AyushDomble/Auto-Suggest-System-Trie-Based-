## **Trie-based Auto-Suggest System** written in **C**.  
This is a console-based auto-suggest and dictionary management system built in C. It uses a Trie data structure for efficient storage and retrieval of words, providing fast auto-suggestions based on a given prefix. The system also includes features for managing a dictionary file, tracking search frequency, and monitoring word additions and deletions within a session.
